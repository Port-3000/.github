## üìå Problem Statement

**Problem Statement 1 ‚Äì Weave AI magic with Groq‚Äôs blazing inference to unlock real-time, privacy-preserving healthcare insights.**

---

## üéØ Objective

What problem does your project solve, and who does it serve?  

- Medical research and machine learning models in healthcare have been historically limited by access to diverse patient data. Due to strict privacy concerns, hospitals cannot share raw patient data. This leads to biased models trained on limited populations. A Secure Federated Learning (FL) System that allows hospitals to collaboratively train machine learning models without exposing raw patient data. Hospitals upload their datasets, train models locally, and share encrypted model weights for collective learning.

Briefly describe the real-world use case and the value it provides.

- A secure federated learning (FL) system where hospitals and research centers (data providers) train local models on sensitive patient data. The model weights are then encrypted and shared to build a robust, global model.
- Addresses a key gap in healthcare AI: the inability to access diverse patient data due to privacy concerns. As a result, traditional ML models are often biased because they‚Äôre trained on limited populations.
